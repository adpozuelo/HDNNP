HDNNP is a feed forward neural network (FFNN) that calculates the macroscopic properties
(energy, pressure, conductivity, etc.) of the atom's system. It does so as follows:

- It learns from the properties of certain sets of systems of atoms (positions in a time sequence and energy for a given temperature and density).

- It predicts the macroscopic properties of another system of different atoms, under temperature and / or density, to those used for learning.

There are examples of atom's systems in "data" directorie (50 boxes are included for each temperature data file).

Requisites
==========

- Software:

  * NVIDIA CUDA Compiler (nvcc)
  * Intel Fortran Compiler (ifort) or GNU Fortran Compiler (gfortran).
  * IMSL Fortran compiled library
  * GNUplot

- Hardware:

  * NVIDIA VGA CUDA capable arquitecture.

Install
=======

<p> Download HDNNP application: </p>

        git clone https://github.com/adpozuelo/HDNNP.git
        cd HDNNP
        
<p> Compile (Makefile is ready for Intel Fortran Compiler)</b>: </p>

        make

<p> Execute HDNNP application (there are execution examples in HDNNP.sh): </p>

        ./HDNNP.sh
